@react-three/xr provides a set of default hands, controllers, transient pointers, gazes, and screen input that can be configured and completely exchanged with your own implementation. The following example shows how to configure the ray color of the ray pointer in the users hand.

```tsx
const store = createXRStore({ hand: { rayPointer: { rayModel: { color: 'red' } } } })
```

In some cases, the default hand/controller/... implementations are not enough. The following code sample shows how to provide your own custom hand implementation though the xr store options.

```tsx
const store = createXRStore({ hand: CustomHand })
```

## Custom Hand

Let's build our own hand implementation which renders the normal hand model but only has a touch interaction which works using the middle finger.

First we're getting the state of the hand, creating a reference to the position of the middle finger, and creating a touch pointer.

```tsx
const state = useXRInputSourceStateContext('hand')
const middleFingerRef = useRef<Object3D>(null)
const pointer = useTouchPointer(middleFingerRef, state)
```

Next, we use the `state` to place an `XRSpace` for setting up the `middleFingerRef` and add an `XRHandModel` and `PointerCursorModel` to render the hand and a cursor visualization.

```tsx
<XRSpace ref={middleFingerRef} space={state.inputSource.hand.get('middle-finger-tip')!}/>
<Suspense>
  <XRHandModel />
</Suspense>
<PointerCursorModel pointer={pointer} opacity={defaultTouchPointerOpacity} />
```

```tsx
export function CustomHand() {
  const state = useXRInputSourceStateContext('hand')
  const middleFingerRef = useRef<Object3D>(null)
  const pointer = useTouchPointer(middleFingerRef, state)
  return (
    <>
      <XRSpace ref={middleFingerRef} space={state.inputSource.hand.get('middle-finger-tip')!} />
      <Suspense>
        <XRHandModel />
      </Suspense>
      <PointerCursorModel pointer={pointer} opacity={defaultTouchPointerOpacity} />
    </>
  )
}
```

This tutorial also applies to building custom controllers, transient pointers, gaze, and screen input implementations.
