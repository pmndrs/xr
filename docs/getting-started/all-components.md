### `XR`

Core XR component for connecting the XR store with the scene. It provides the XR store to its children.

### `XROrigin`

Component for setting the origin of the player (their feet).

### `XRControllerComponent`

Component for placing content in the controller, anchored at a specific component such as the Thumbstick.

- `id`: The ID of the component (e.g., `"a-button"`).
- `onPress`: Optional callback to be invoked when the component is pressed.
- `onRelease`: Optional callback to be invoked when the component is released.

Allows children to be placed inside for purposes such as visualizing a tooltip over the button.

### `XRControllerModel`

Component for rendering a 3D model for the XRController.

- `colorWrite`: Property to configure color writing.
- `renderOrder`: Property to configure render order.

### `XRHandJoint`

Component for placing content in the hand, anchored at a specific joint such as the index fingertip.

- `joint`: The name of the joint (e.g., `"wrist"`).

Allows children to be placed inside for purposes such as visualizing a tooltip over the index fingertip.

### `XRHandModel`

Component for rendering a 3D model for the XRHand.

- `colorWrite`: Property to configure color writing.
- `renderOrder`: Property to configure render order.

### `XRMeshModel`

Component that positions its children in the provided space.

- `space`: Property to provide the xr space or the reference space type, such as `"viewer"`.

### `TeleportTarget`

Component that allows to declare its children as teleport targets.

### `XRLayer`

Component for rendering high quality quad, cylinder, or equirectangular layers inside supported sessions while including a fallback for not supported sessions.

- `src`: Property for displaying images and videos onto the layer. For rendering dynamic content to the layer, leave the `src` empty and put the the dynamic (3D) content into the children so the layer acts as a render target. 
- `shape`: Property to configure the shape of the layer (`"quad"`, `"cylinder"`, `"equirectangular"`).
- `layout`: Property to configure the layout of the display content for stereo content (`"default"`, `"mono"`, `"stereo-left-right"`, `"stereo-top-bottom"`).
- `centralAngle`: Property to configure the central angle in case the layer `shape` is a `"cylinder"`.
- `centralHorizontalAngle`: Property to configure the central horizontal angle in case the layer `shape` is `"equirectangular"`.

- `chromaticAberrationCorrection`: Property to configure whether chromatic abberration should be corrected by the layer.
- `quality`: Property to configure for what type of content the layer should be optimized (`"default"`, `"text-optimized"`, `"graphics-optimized"`).

The component also accepts properties for changing the scale, position, rotation, and more.

### `NotInXR`

Component for hiding the xr context to all children component. Can be used to create virtual displays and similar allowing the components inside the display to think they are not inside an XR environment, making them behave like when outside XR.

## Pointer

The core interaction concept is based on (touch/grab/ray) pointers.

### `CombinedPointer`

Component for combining multiple pointers into one so that only one pointer is active at each time.

### `PointerCursorModel`

Component for rendering a cursor for a pointer.

### `PointerRayModel`

Component for rendering a ray for a pointer.
